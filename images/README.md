## Image Guidelines

### File Formats
- **Photos**: JPG (optimized, 80-85% quality)
- **Graphics/Logos**: PNG or SVG (SVG preferred for logos)
- **Icons**: SVG when possible

### Optimization
- Compress all images before uploading
- Recommended tools:
  - TinyPNG: https://tinypng.com/
  - Squoosh: https://squoosh.app/
  - ImageOptim (Mac): https://imageoptim.com/

### Sizing Recommendations
- **Hero images**: Max 1920px wide
- **Feature images**: Max 800px wide
- **Thumbnails**: Max 400px wide
- Keep file sizes under 200KB when possible

### Accessibility Requirements
**All images must have:**
1. Descriptive alt text in HTML
2. Appropriate file names (e.g., "child-reading-book.jpg" not "IMG_1234.jpg")

**Decorative images:**
- Use empty alt attribute: `alt=""`
- Or set as CSS background image

### Suggested Images Needed

- Logo (SVG or high-res PNG with transparent background)
- Classroom photos
- Facility exterior/interior
- Children learning (with photo release permissions)
- Staff photos
- Outdoor play areas

### Legal Considerations
- Ensure you have permission/releases for all photos
- Don't use stock photos with recognizable people without proper licensing
- Check with client for existing photo library
