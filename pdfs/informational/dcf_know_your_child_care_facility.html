      <p>
        Quality child care offers healthy, social, and educational experiences under qualified supervision
        in a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment. Children in these settings participate in daily,
        age-appropriate activities that help develop essential skills, build independence and instill self-respect.
        When evaluating the quality of a child care setting, you should consider the facility’s quality indicators
        related to activities, caregivers, and environment.
